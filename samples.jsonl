{"chat_history": [{"inputs": {"question": "What is ChatGPT?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "ChatGPT is a chatbot product developed by OpenAI. It is powered by the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series of language models, with GPT-4 being the latest version. ChatGPT uses natural language processing to generate responses to user inputs in a conversational manner. It was released as ChatGPT Plus, a premium version, which provides enhanced features and access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API. ChatGPT allows users to interact and have conversations with the language model, utilizing both text and image inputs. It is designed to be more reliable, creative, and capable of handling nuanced instructions compared to previous versions. However, it is important to note that while GPT-4 improves upon its predecessors, it still retains some of the same limitations and challenges."}}],"question": "How is it different than previous models?","context": "ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, known for its ability to engage in human-like conversations and provide informative responses.","ground_truth": "ChatGPT has more parameters and is trained on a larger amount of data.s"}

His famous equation E=mc^2 has been called 'the world's most famous equation'. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical physics, and he made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics."}}], "question": "When did he die?", "context": "Albert Einstein is widely regarded as one of the most influential physicists of the 20th century, known for his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics and the development of the theory of relativity. Einstein died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm on April 18, 1955. He was 76. Smoking makes one roughly eight times more likely to develop an aneurysm; Einstein was a devotee to pipe-smoking.", "ground_truth": "He did on April 18, 1955"}
